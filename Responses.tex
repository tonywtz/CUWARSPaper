\noindent \textbf{Re: Manuscript \textquotedblleft A Risk-based Theory
  of Exchange Rate Stabilization \textquotedblright }

\bigskip

\noindent Dear Veronica,

\bigskip


\noindent
Please find enclosed an extensive revision of the above-mentioned manuscript. 

We much appreciate the very useful comments by you and the referees.
We have incorporated all of your suggestions and almost all of the
suggestions from the referees in the revised version of the paper.

We would like to thank you for pushing us on various aspects of the
paper. We tightened up loose pieces and added additional analysis. We
believe that the resulting paper is much better than the previous
version. We hope you agree with this assessment.

Here is an overview of the main changes we made following your and the
referees' comments:

\begin{itemize}
\item FIXME
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

More specifically, following the ordering in your letter:

\textit{Referee 1 makes two main recommendations in terms of exposition that are easy
to implement and you should do so ...}

\begin{itemize}
\item FIXME
\end{itemize}

\textit{I recommend you to follow his/her ``less extensive''
  suggestion of using a model of currency market segmentation only in
  the last section of the paper.}

\begin{itemize}
\item FIXME
\end{itemize}

\textit{Finally, Referee 3 is the negative one... In the revision you
  should address this concern and clarify the analysis.}

\begin{itemize}
\item FIXME
\end{itemize}

In addition to your comments above, we incorporated almost all
suggestions from the referees. Our responses to their comments are
summarized at the end of this letter. We found the comments of all
three referees to be very useful and would like to thank them for
their time and for their suggestions.

Thank you very much again for giving us an opportunity to revise the
paper, and we hope that you will find the revision to be responsive to
all of your comments and to almost all of the comments of the
referees. Needless to say, we would be happy to incorporate any
further suggestions you have.

\section*{Referee 1}
\noindent We would like to thank the referee for their thorough
reading of the previous draft, the careful review, and the excellent
comments they provided. We tried to address all of the comments we
could. As a result, we think our new draft is much cleaner and better
than the previous version. We therefore thank the referee for pushing
us on various aspects of the paper.

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.1] \textit{Change the tone of the introduction...}

\item FIXME

\item[$\rightarrow $] FIXME.

\section*{Referee 3}
\noindent We would like to thank the referee for their thorough
reading of the previous draft, the careful review, and the excellent
comments they provided. We tried to address all of the comments we
could. As a result, we think our new draft is much cleaner and better
than the previous version. And we much appreciate your careful review
of our previous draft. We therefore thank the referee for pushing us
on various aspects of the paper.

\begin{itemize}
\item[3.1] \textit{The authors should discuss (a) what happens to
    non-traded good prices under lasseiz faire and tax policy ...}

\item FIXME

\item[$\rightarrow $] FIXME

\item[3.2] \textit{... (b) whether deviations from the law of one
    price are also necessary in models with specialized tradables
    hence with terms of trade fluctuations.}

\item[$\rightarrow $] FIXME

\item[3.3] \textit{How can a tax improve the allocation? The claim is
    that each country is a monopolistic supplier of own non-traded
    goods is not convincing.}

\item FIXME

\item[$\rightarrow $] FIXME
